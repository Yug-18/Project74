          The mission of the Church is to prepare the way for the final establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth.
          Its purpose is, first, to develop in men's lives Christ-like attributes; and, second, to transform society
          so that the world may be a better and more peaceful place in which to live.</p>

          <p>Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked
            when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It
            was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very
            first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I
            decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision
            to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was
            not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and
            because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle
            for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

            <p>my team was working very hard to win the Inter-school Football championship so as we won it. I and my
              team are very happy today. This victory was our dream for a long time. The last goal of the match was hit
              by me. I was very nervous at that time but when I saw I made it, the entire school watching the match
              stand and cheered up for me and my team. It was the most beautiful movement in my life. I am very happy.
              Thank you diary for listening to my feelings all days.</p>

                    been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, ad detailed descriptions of
                    their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or
                    staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school
                    website that keeps track of their prevoius meal choices and any dietry requirements they may have.
                    Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money
                    handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, DIVERSITY
                    IS THE KEY.</p>
